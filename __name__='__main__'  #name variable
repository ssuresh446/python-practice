============
earlier the __name__ in calc shown as __main__, but here 
if we import this calc file in another file, then in the output 
of other file its showing __name__ as calc(which is name of the module). observe carefully.
but we dont want to display the unwanted data in the present file output for using
that module for some other purpose. for this follow the below file
