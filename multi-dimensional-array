# if we have number of elements in single array , we call it as array or single dimensional array.
# if we have number of arrays in single array, then we call it as multi dimensional array.

we can do using array also and directly by matrix also .
by using array :
from numpy import *
a=array([
    [1,3,5],
    [2,4,6],
    [7,8,9]])
print(a)
print(a.diagonal())
print(a.min())
print(a.max())
print(a.dtype)
print(a.flatten())
print(a.reshape(1,3,3))
print(a.reshape(3,1,3))
print(a.reshape(3,3,1))
print(len(a))
print(a.mean())
print(a.size)


by using matrix:
