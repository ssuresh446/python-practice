#there are 3 types of errors
#1)compile time error : syntax and spelling mistake
#2)logical error : compiled successfully but gives wrong output(3-1=5).
#3)runtime error : code gets compiled and not giving either compile time error or logical error also.
#but the user might give wrong input while compilation(4/0).
#compile time error is most easiest error for developer.
#runtime error is difficult but it is due to input given by user but not out mistake.

if there is no error , above program is correct but above program is gone through exception, we may get wrong indication as following.

again in the above program, we are not getting resource closed., so follow the below.

try:
    print('resource open')
    print(a / b)

finally:
    print('resource closed')
print('Bye')

finally will be executed always even we get error or even we dont get error also.
