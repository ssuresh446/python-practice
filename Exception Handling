#there are 3 types of errors
#1)compile time error : syntax and spelling mistake
#2)logical error : compiled successfully but gives wrong output(3-1=5).
#3)runtime error : code gets compiled and not giving either compile time error or logical error also.
#but the user might give wrong input while compilation(4/0).
#compile time error is most easiest error for developer.
#runtime error is difficult but it is due to input given by user but not out mistake.
