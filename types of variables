Class variable or Static variable

class car:
    wheels=4
    def __init__(self):
        self.milage=10
        self.company='BMW'
car1=car()
car2=car()
print(car1.company,car1.milage)
print(car2.company,car2.milage)
print(car1.wheels)
print(car2.wheels)
car1.company='mahindra'
car2.milage=20
car.wheels=6
print(car1.company,car1.milage)
print(car2.company,car2.milage)
print(car1.wheels)
print(car2.wheels)

====================================================================
in the above case, wheels are same for every object(car1,car2) so it is called Class variable or Static variables.
we can mention static variables out of init function and inside class.

where as .. comany name, milage, car number etc. are different for every car . so the details changes according to object.
so it is called instance varibles.

but we can change both variables at anytime if we want to change.
